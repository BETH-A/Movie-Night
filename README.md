Movie Night Out (Project 1 Group Project)

 https://beth-a.github.io/Project-1/
 
 Group project developed with 3 classmates.  This web app uses an API to get data from an external site to render current movies and some of the info regarding that movie on our HTML page.
 
 We used a new technology not taught in class called a Magnifier to magnify elements of the movie poster.
